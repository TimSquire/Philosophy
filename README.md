Philosophy was a school project I got 100% on that I decided to buy a domain for. All of the login, sign-up, modal, menus/links and admin funstionality was created by myself over the span of about a month. I ocassionally make subtle changes throughout the school year, however I have plans to add some interesting features in the near future.

Philosophy allows anyone to log into the website and look at post previews. However, to view entire posts users will be prompted to login. After logging in/creating an account, users can opt to become an author which allows them to create posts. Otherwise, users can simply view all posts either in a main feed or by catergory and through a search by keyword.
